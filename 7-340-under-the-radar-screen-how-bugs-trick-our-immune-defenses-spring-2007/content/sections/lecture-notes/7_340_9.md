description: This resource contains lecture notes on how the immune system sends cytotoxic
  T-cells on a mission to search and destroy those cells that present pathogen-derived
  antigens on their class I major histocompatibility complexes, how pathogens interfere
  with the processing and presentation of antigens associated with MHC complexes as
  well as the expression of these complexes on the cell surface, that immune evasion
  of this sort is countered by natural killer (NK) cells, which sense a reduction
  in surface MHC and move in for the kill, and how cytomegalovirus diverts the NK-cell
  mediated destruction by the expression of surrogate MHC molecules that interact
  with NK inhibitory receptors.
