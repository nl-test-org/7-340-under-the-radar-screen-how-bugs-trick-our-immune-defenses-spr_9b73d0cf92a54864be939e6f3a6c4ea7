description: This resource contains lecture notes on cell interference with viral
  or bacterial infection by apoptosis (programmed cell death) to destroy the environment
  in which the pathogen thrives, how viruses such as Mixoma virus and Epstein Barr
  virus (EBV) can express proteins that block apoptosis and allow them to survive,
  that such mechanisms usually target the mitochondria, which is a key organelle in
  the process of apoptosis, and that this strategy can be associated with virally-induced
  cancers, such as the Burkitt's B cell lymphoma caused by EBV.
