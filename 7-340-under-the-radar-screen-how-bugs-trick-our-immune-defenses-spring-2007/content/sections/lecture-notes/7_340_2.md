description: This resource contains lecture notes on the concept of phagocytosis (engulfment
  of large particles by the cell membranes of immune cells) with an emphasis on the
  difference from macropinocytosis, how Salmonella can evade efficient phagocytosis
  by triggering macropinocytosis and modifying the environment of the phagosome to
  promote its survival, and how techniques used in the field to answer similar questions
  have evolved over the years.
